# Security Improvements for Supabase Database

## Overview
This document outlines all the security improvements implemented to address Supabase Security Advisor warnings and errors in the Menu Mestre Fácil project.

## Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation
- **Enabled RLS** on all public tables
- **waiter_calls table**: Previously had RLS disabled, now properly secured
- **Consistent policy structure** across all tables

### 2. Policy Management
- **Removed duplicate policies** that were causing conflicts
- **Standardized policy naming** for better maintainability
- **Added missing policies** for tables that lacked proper access control

#### Current RLS Policies:
- **restaurants**: User ownership-based access control
- **categories**: Restaurant ownership-based access control
- **dishes**: Restaurant ownership-based access control
- **menus**: Restaurant ownership-based access control
- **profiles**: User ownership-based access control
- **complement_groups**: Restaurant ownership-based access control
- **complements**: Restaurant ownership-based access control
- **dish_categories**: Restaurant ownership-based access control
- **waiter_calls**: Restaurant ownership-based access control

### 3. Function Security
- **Added SECURITY DEFINER** to all custom functions
- **Explicit search_path** specification to prevent search path injection
- **User ownership validation** in import functions
- **Input sanitization** functions for text processing

### 4. Data Validation Constraints
- **String length limits** for names and descriptions
- **URL validation** for image URLs (must start with http:// or https://)
- **Phone number validation** for WhatsApp (international format with + prefix)
- **Price validation** (non-negative values)

### 5. UUID Generation Consistency
- **Standardized on gen_random_uuid()** for all tables
- **Removed mixed uuid_generate_v4()** usage
- **Consistent primary key generation** across all tables

### 6. Public Access Control
- **Public read access** for menu display (restaurants, categories, dishes)
- **Restricted write access** to authenticated users only
- **Owner-based permissions** for all modifications

### 7. Audit Trail
- **audit_log table** for tracking sensitive operations
- **User action logging** with timestamps
- **JSON storage** for old/new values
- **RLS protection** on audit data

### 8. Performance and Security Indexes
- **Foreign key indexes** for faster joins
- **User ID indexes** for policy evaluation
- **Restaurant ID indexes** for ownership checks

### 9. Input Sanitization
- **SQL injection prevention** functions
- **Control character removal**
- **Comment stripping** from user input

### 10. Rate Limiting
- **Operation rate limiting** functions
- **Configurable time windows** and limits
- **Audit-based tracking** of user actions

## Security Functions Added

### `check_rate_limit(operation, limit_seconds, max_operations)`
- Prevents abuse of sensitive operations
- Configurable time windows and limits
- Returns boolean for operation allowance

### `sanitize_text_input(input_text)`
- Removes SQL injection patterns
- Strips control characters
- Sanitizes user input before processing

### `log_audit_entry(table_name, operation, record_id, old_values, new_values)`
- Logs all sensitive operations
- Tracks user actions for compliance
- Stores before/after data states

### `get_public_restaurant_data(restaurant_slug)`
- Safe public data access function
- No sensitive information exposure
- Proper access control enforcement

## Public Views

### `public_menu_view`
- **Read-only view** for public menu display
- **No sensitive data** exposed
- **Proper permissions** for anonymous and authenticated users

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Input Validation**: All user input is validated and sanitized
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of sensitive operations
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevention of abuse and DoS attacks
6. **Secure Functions**: All functions use SECURITY DEFINER
7. **Explicit Search Paths**: Prevention of search path injection
8. **Data Constraints**: Validation at the database level

## Tables and Their Security Status

| Table | RLS Enabled | Policy Count | Security Level |
|-------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| restaurants | ✅ | 3 | High |
| categories | ✅ | 2 | High |
| dishes | ✅ | 3 | High |
| menus | ✅ | 2 | High |
| profiles | ✅ | 4 | High |
| complement_groups | ✅ | 2 | High |
| complements | ✅ | 2 | High |
| dish_categories | ✅ | 1 | High |
| waiter_calls | ✅ | 4 | High |
| audit_log | ✅ | 1 | High |

## Recommendations for Ongoing Security

1. **Regular Policy Review**: Audit RLS policies quarterly
2. **Function Security**: Review all custom functions for security issues
3. **Audit Log Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
4. **Input Validation**: Maintain strict input validation rules
5. **Rate Limit Tuning**: Adjust rate limits based on usage patterns
6. **Security Updates**: Keep Supabase and dependencies updated

## Compliance Notes

- **GDPR Ready**: User data isolation through RLS
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging for compliance requirements
- **Data Minimization**: Public views expose only necessary data
- **Access Control**: Strict user ownership validation

## Testing Security

To test the security implementation:

1. **Authentication Tests**: Verify unauthenticated users cannot access private data
2. **Cross-User Access**: Ensure users cannot access other users' data
3. **Policy Validation**: Test all CRUD operations through RLS policies
4. **Function Security**: Verify functions respect user context
5. **Input Validation**: Test with malicious input patterns

## Migration History

- `fix_security_issues`: Initial security fixes and RLS policies
- `cleanup_duplicate_policies_and_add_security`: Policy cleanup and constraints
- `fix_whatsapp_phone_format`: Data format standardization
- `apply_security_constraints`: Security constraints and audit trail
- `final_security_hardening_final`: Final security functions and views

All migrations have been successfully applied and the database is now secured according to industry best practices.
